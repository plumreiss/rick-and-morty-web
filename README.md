# Ricknedy
Ricknedy is a website where you can find information about the rick and morty series, such as characters, locations and episodes.

## Why i made ricknedy?

I created ricknedy because while watching the series I wanted to know what types of characters, species that were in the series so I got down to work. While I was creating the page, I also added new features, like knowing the characters that are at certain places and the characters that appear in the episodes.
